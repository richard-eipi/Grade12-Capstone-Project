# Richard Soma's Grade 12 Capstone Project at Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School, Vancouver, BC, Canada

A short demo with images: https://github.com/richard-eipi/Grade12-Capstone-Project/blob/main/Short%20Demo%20with%20Images.pdf.

Mentor & programming teacher: Ms Braaten

Language: Python 3.7.5

Libraries: Pygame 1.9.6, Stackless 3.7.5

General game design: It's basically Pokemon battles, but more complicated and strategic with a "slightly" different set of rules. There is no PVE or online PVP, just like playing chess with yourself...

Champion: Something like a Pokemon; has "abilities", "special buffs", and 5 "moves" only. User can adjust "level of expertise" to increase the stats of a champion and select "special traits" and "titles" to make it stronger.

Game modes:
 - 1V1 battle: for project submission, done in January 2020.
 - 2V2 battle: extension, done in March 2020.

It's sphagetti code with dirty architecture, poor convention, and almost no comments. I consider it a miracle that it actually runs, and I believe that this stinky game has great potentials to become a masterpiece. Maybe some day in the future...
